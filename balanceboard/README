Arikado's Wii Homebrew git : Balance Board
---------------------------------------------------------------

About:

Programs written to test the balance board as Ave and I developed a libogc driver for it.

License:

Ave put his own copyright on the programs, I never even put my name on them and don't really plan to.

Miscellaneous:

Please feel free to contact me at castlevania7689 <at> yahoo <dot> com if you do anything cool with anything in this git. Thanks.
