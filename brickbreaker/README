Arikado's Wii Homebrew git : WiiBreaker
---------------------------------------------------------------

About:

A brickbreaker game I wrote in libwiisprite. I wanted to do more with it but ultimately abandoned it work on other more interesting things.

License:

There is no license.

Miscellaneous:

You'll need libwiisprite and ftimage to compile.

Please feel free to contact me at castlevania7689 <at> yahoo <dot> com if you do anything cool with anything in this git. Thanks.
