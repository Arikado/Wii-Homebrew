		The Balance Board is composed of 4 pressure sensors. One in the top left,
		one in the top right, one in the bottom left, and one in the bottom right.
		Represented by the variables (respectively) tl, tr, bl, br. However, we don't
		need to worry about these sensors to move the paddle. No, the Balance Board
		struct creates an X and Y coordinate based on the amount of pressure on each
		side of the board.
		
		Positive X = More pressure is on the right of the Balance Board
		Negative X = More pressure is on the left of the Balance Board
		Positive Y = More Pressure is on the bottom of the Balance Board
		Negative Y = More pressure is on the top of the Balance Board
		
		If X or Y equal zero that means that there is an equal amount of pressure on either the
		horizontal or vertical sides of the board respectively.
		
		Think of all this as a grid. And that there is a point in the center until the board is stepped upon:
		
	        |                                                                         
		|
		|
	      -1|
	        |
	       0|                                     *Center Point
	        |
	       1|
		|
		|
	        |_________________________________-1___0___1________________________________
		
		And now, think of how this point would move as you put pressure on different parts of the board.
		So as you but pressure on the top of the board, the Y value decreases and is output negatively.
		
		When I move my paddle in WiiBreaker, I move it according to the X value. The higher or lower
		the value, the faster or slower the speed of the paddle in the pressured direction.
